**Hey\! Got a question about the pack? Chances are, it's one that gets frequently asked \- see if any of these answers are what you need, and you can ask any further questions in [the Discord](https://discord.gg/jxNe26WNYh).**

## **Q1: What's the best way to install the modpack?**

  A: Your best option is using [**Prism Launcher**](https://prismlauncher.org/download/?from=link), a lightweight, more feature-rich version of **MultiMC** \- after installing it and creating an instance, you can click on **CurseForge** on the left side of the instance window and search for **Raspberry Flavoured**, select the version you want (preferably the latest) and have it install the pack for you. It'll likely mention there are some mods it can't download due to said mods blocking third-party apps from downloading them, but with the click of a button, Prism will automatically open the mods up in your browser and download them, after which you can direct Prism to the folder in which the mods have been downloaded and it'll add the mods to the pack for you\! [**CurseForge's own launcher**](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) is also not a bad option, though it's quite a slow launcher and is generally rather bloated with a lot of stuff you may not want \- once again, using Prism is highly recommended\!

## **Q2: How do I play with friends / Where is the server pack?**
  A: For the current, latest release, you can find the server pack made by [@Cassian](https://modrinth.com/user/Cassian) by clicking [here](server)! It is actively updated and maintained for every release, though do be patient whenever a new release is out, the server pack may not update immediately.

  Alternatively, you can use either [**Essential**](https://modrinth.com/mod/essential/version/mO5ESCdv) or [**World Host**](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-host/version/0.5.1+1.19.2-forge) to play together with friends without any server setup, though do keep in mind that this is more of a quick and dirty method, and is not fully supported.

##   **Q3: Where is the in-game languages menu?**

  A: The pack was not built with language support in mind, with no language besides English supporting the various custom items in the pack or existing items whose names were changed \- unfortunately, it's likely there will not be language support for a long while, if ever.

## **Q4: Why are Villagers / Illagers / The End / some enchantments / (insert some other major feature) disabled?**

  A: The reason most of these major features are disabled/removed is usually either for balancing purposes, or simply a difference in opinion \- I am personally not a fan of features such as Villagers and the End dimension, and don't consider them worth attempting to balance and/or modify. If you disagree and/or find any of these changes to be a dealbreaker, I wish you the best in finding or even making a pack more suited to your own tastes \- really, this is the first ever full-fledged pack I've made\! You can do it too, so long as you have an idea and put your mind to it :)

##   **Q5: How do I re-enable disabled features?**

  A: You don't.

##   **Q6: What's the goal of this pack?**

  A: There really isn't a set goal \- it's similar to vanilla in that you're expected to mostly set your own goals, though the pack does make early game progression a little bit more streamlined to get you going \- if you're ever stuck, you can check the **advancements** screen using the book button in your inventory, check if an item has a description by hovering over it and pressing R or U while EMI is toggled on (if it isn't toggled, you can click the recipe book in your inventory, or hit **Shift \+ R**), or simply ask in the Discord.

##   **Q7: When is the next release?**

  A: The answer to this question is, and will likely always be, **I don't know** \- we never have a specific schedule or timeline for updates, and it's likely that updates beyond bugfixes will come to an end not very far into the future as is, because there's only so much you can do with a modpack before it basically becomes so different that you may as well make a new pack. The short answer is always that **it will come when it's ready.**

##   **Q8: Why are pigs following me?**

  A: What pigs? What're you talking about? Are you okay?

## **Q9: Will RF ever be updated to 1.20 / 1.21?**
  A: Very unlikely \- RF is highly dependent on its specific selection of mods, and even just a few of them missing may still hinder a decent bit of the experience \- not to mention, updating a modpack isn't nearly as simple as dragging the old files into a new version, there are a lot of factors to consider, especially when there's custom content added with a mod like KubeJS. What you *can* look forward to however, is a *different* pack also made by me that's on a future version\! I have a couple of them in the works, not sure which'll see the light of day first \- but rest assured, keep an eye out\!

##   **Q10: I'm having rendering / performance issues with Create's machines, what can I do?**
  A: Try fiddling with the configuration for Create's rendering engine, Flywheel \- you can either go into the config file at `(RF folder) > config > flywheel-client.toml` and switch the **backend** to either "batching" or "instancing" \- alternatively, run either the `/flywheel backend instancing` or `/flywheel backend batching` commands in-game to do the same thing \- the option that works best for you will depend on your hardware, so just try them out and see how things go.

##  **Q11: The pack launches and loads until 99%, but then it freezes up! What's wrong?**
  A: Try disabling the **Skip Launcher** setting in CurseForge's launcher \- if that's not the launcher you're using, make a post in our Discord's support channel and we'll help out.

##  **Q12: How do I install / use shaders with this modpack?**

  A: It's fairly simple - installing the Oculus mod (and disabling Rubidium which gets auto-installed alongside Oculus) is the first step \- you can find an official guide made by \@n√∂elle for setting up shaders by [clicking here](https://moddedmc.wiki/en/project/raspberry-core/docs/rf/shaders)!

## **Q13: Can I update my world from an old / previous version of the pack to the latest version?**
  A: It depends, if you made your world after RF 2.2 pre-release 2 or any of the 3.0 pre-releases, it should still work fine with only a few minor oddities \- however, if your world was made in either RF 2.1 or 2.2 pre-release 1, updating it to the latest version will more than likely cause a lot of problems.

Additionally, whenever the pack updates, it's recommended that you make a brand new instance for the new version and move your worlds over, rather than directly updating your existing instance, as this allows the configuration files, data packs and various other things to be updated correctly and safely.

## **Q14: Does this modpack have / will this modpack update to Create 6.0?**
  A: Unfortunately no, RF is only available on Minecraft 1.19.2, and Create 6.0 is only available on versions 1.20.1 and 1.21.1 \- Create has already dropped support for 1.20.1 after the release of 6.0, so it's near-impossible that they'll ever backport the update to 1.19.2, which is a nearly 3-year-old version of Minecraft as of the time this is written.

## **Q15: How do I make Diamond Boots / other Mechanical Crafter recipes with a gap in the middle?**
  A: This is explained in the Ponder scene of the Mechanical Crafter block, which you can watch by hovering over one in your inventory and holding the W key \- you can place extra Mechanical Crafters where the gap would be to complete the grid, and then forcefully activate the crafting process by giving any one of the crafters a redstone pulse, or alternatively you can use Slot Covers on the empty crafters to initiate the process as normal.
