title: Raspberry Flavoured - Vanilla Changes
hide_meta: true
---

In Raspberry Flavoured, some content from vanilla Minecraft has been changed or removed due to balancing reasons and personal choice.

## Villages

Villages, Villagers, Illagers, Pillager Outposts and Patrols, Wandering Traders, and other related features have been removed. There are some remnants of their existence, like golems and various rare artifacts.

### Cats

Notably, the removal of villages changes the process of obtaining cats. Cats can now be obtained either by finding a natural spawn in a **Witch Hut**, or by getting an **Ocelot** to trust you (by feeding it fish) and then feeding it **Cat Food** to convert it into a cat.

## The Nether

The process of traveling to the Nether has been changed. While a portal frame is still constructed of a minimum of 10-14 Obsidian in a 4x5 shape as normal, it must be lit with **Dimensional Tears**. Dimensional Tears can be obtained by using a Glass Bottle on Crying Obsidian, or alternatively by killing Witches or looting their huts.

Crying Obsidian can be found in the Overworld at ruined portals. These ruined portals can either be discovered naturally or intentionally sought out by crafting **Awoken Exopearls**, which will fly towards the nearest ruined portal structure in the same manner as Eyes of Ender.

## The End

The End has been entirely removed, with some of its content altered to fit new themes.

### Eye of Ender

Eyes of Ender have been renamed to **Awoken Exopearls**. With no End dimension, they required a new purpose. They now look for ruined structures such as Shipwrecks, Ruined Portals, and Bastion Remnants. The Awoken Exopearl has a sister called the **Spirited Exopearl**, which looks for structures with spawners such as Dungeons, Mineshafts, and Nether Fortresses. Finding your first Blaze Spawner will be easier than ever!

### Ender Chest

The Ender Chest has been renamed to the **Exovault**. You'll find a very familiar recipe and texturing but for a colour palette change to match the **Exokin**. As well, the recipe now outputs a pair.

### Shulker Boxes

Shulker Boxes in Raspberry Flavoured have been re-named and re-themed into **Terrabins**, crafted with Turtle Scutes and a Soul Bead. For early-game and mid-game inventory solutions:

* **Bundles** serve the purpose of being able to pack together multiple types of items into a single 64-stack slot.
* **Sacks** are essentially lesser Terrabins with 12 slots.

Additionally, the contents of Bundles, Sacks, and Terrabins can be scrolled through in the inventory using the mouse scroll wheel.

### Endermen

Endermen have been re-themed to **Exokin**. Their mechanics have not changed — only their visuals, name, and home. More will be revealed in future updates.

## Minecraft Magic

### Experience & Enchanting

Experience has been entirely removed in Raspberry Flavoured, and with this, enchanting has been revamped. **Enchanted Tablets** can be created in the Forge, which can then be applied to armor and tools in a Smithing Table.

The enchantments that remain are intended to be less "one size fits all." This encourages players to choose enchantments that best fit their individual play-style while considering the [innate abilities](gear) that certain armor and tool materials possess.

Each applied tablet results in one level of the enchantment. Holding shift over the tablet will tell you what each enchantment does as well as what its max level will be.

### Brewing & Effects

Brewing stands have been removed, but that does not mean the removal of potions. Potions are still gated behind finding your first Blazes by using the **Create mod's** heated mixing. Simply capture the soul of a Blaze in a **Blaze Burner**; when placed under your Basin, they will heat things up once given fuel. Potion effects and names have changed, along with the addition of new effects (both good and bad) such as **Maturity** and **Tipsy**.

There are also new methods to gain effects beyond potions and beacons. The food you eat and drinks you drink can provide various benefits:

* **Comfort & Satiation:** The most common effects, which help keep your health and food saturation in check. Comfort can also be gained by placing a lit campfire in your vicinity.
* **Niche Buffs:** Foods like **Crimson Stroganoff** can keep you free from flames on those hot Nether trips.
