title: Raspberry Flavoured - Vanilla Changes
hide_meta: true
---

In Raspberry Flavoured, some content from vanilla Minecraft has been changed and removed due to balancing reasons and personal choices.

## Villages

Villages, Villagers, Illagers, Pillager Outposts and Patrols, Wandering Traders, and other related features have been removed. There are some remnants of their existence, like golems, and various rare artifacts.

### Cats

Notably, the removal of villages changes the process of obtaining cats. Cats can now be obtained either by finding a natural spawn in a Witch Hut, or by getting an Ocelot to trust you by feeding it fish, and then feeding it cat food to convert it into a cat.

## The Nether

The process of traveling to the Nether has been changed. While a portal frame is still constructed of a minimum of 10-14 Obsidian in a 4x5 shape as normal, it must be lit with Dimensional Tears. Dimensional Tears can be obtained by using a Glass Bottle on Crying Obsidian, and alternatively by killing Witches or looting their huts.

Crying Obsidian can be found in the Overworld at ruined portals. These ruined portals can either be discovered naturally, or intentionally sought out by crafting Awoken Exopearls, which will fly towards the nearest ruined portal structure in the same manner as Eyes of Ender.

## The End

The End has been entirely removed, with some of its content altered to fit new themes.

### Shulker Boxes

Shulker Boxes in Raspberry Flavoured have been re-named and re-themed into Terrabins, crafted with Turtle Scutes and a Soul Bead. For early-game and mid-game inventory solutions, Bundles serve the purpose of being able to pack together multiple types of items into a single 64-stack slot, while Sacks are essentially lesser Terrabins with 12 slots. Additionally, Bundles, Sacks and Terrabins' contents can be scrolled through in the inventory using the mouse scroll wheel.

### Endermen

Endermen have been re-themed to Exokin. Their mechanics have not changed, only their visuals, name and home. More will be revealed in future updates.

## Minecraft Magic

### Experience & Enchanting

Experience has been entirely removed in Raspberry Flavoured, and with this, enchanting has been revamped. Enchanted Tablets can be created in the Forge, which can be applied to armor and tools in a Smithing Table.

The enchantments that remain in Raspberry Flavoured are intended to be less "one size fits all", to encourage choosing the enchantments that fit individual players' play-style the best and considering what [innate abilities](gear) some armor and tool materials possess as well.

### Brewing & Effects

Brewing stands have been removed, but that does not come with the removal of potions. Potions are still gated behind finding your first blazes due using the Create mod's heated mixing. Simply capture the soul of a blaze in a blaze burner, and sitting under your basin, they will heat things up upon being given fuel. Potion and effects have changed, along with their names, as well as the addition of new effects, good and bad such as Maturity and Tipsy.

As with the examples provided earlier, there are new methods to gain effects on top of the usual potions and beacons. Now the very food you eat and drinks you...drink, can now provide you with effects. The most common of which will be Comfort and Satiation, which will respectively help keep your health and food saturation in check. Comfort can also be gained by placing a lit campfire in your vicinity. More niche effects can also be granted from food such as eating Crimson Stroganoff to keep you free from flames on those hot nether trips.
