hide_meta: true
---

In Raspberry Flavoured, most tools and armor have been changed to have their own unique properties instead of just being incremental upgrades, and various new sets have been added.

# Tools

Due to each tools ability, it will not be as simple as upgrading from one tier to another. Rose Gold Tools will always have a place at all levels of the game due to it's silk touch properties.

## Pre-Iron Tier

- Wooden tools have no special properties.
- Copper tools replace stone tools and visually oxidize. 

## Iron Tier

- Golden tools have fortune / looting properties. 
- Iron tools have no special properties.
- Rose gold tools have silk touch properties and deal armor-piercing magic damage. 
- Steel tools are slow but deal knockback.

## Diamond Tier

- Diamond tools have no special properties.

## Netherite Tier

- Electrum tools are speedy and deal kinetic damage.
- Necromium tools slow targets.
- Netherite tools smelt the drops of mined blocks and light targets on fire. Additionally, items made of Netherite do not burn when thrown into fire or lava.

# Armour

Due to each armour pieces' ability, it will not be as simple as upgrading from one tier to another. Golden Armour's fire protection will remain useful at all stages of the game until you get Netherite and Griefer Armour will still be the best Creeper fighting armour.

## Pre-Iron Tier

- Leather armor grants fall damage resistance.
- Copper armor grants Aftershock, a new status effect, when the wearer is struck by lightning.

## Iron Tier

- Chainmail armor deals damage to attackers and has been made craftable.
- Golden armor grants slight protection against fire damage.
- Iron armour has no special properties.
- Rose Gold armor grants protection against magic damage.
- Steel armor grants protection against projectile damage and resists knockback.

## Diamond Tier

- Griefer armor grants high protection against explosion damage.
- Sanguine armor has lifesteal properties, healing the wearer as they deal damage.
- Diamond armor has no special properties.

## Netherite Tier

- Electrum armor increases movement speed.
- Necromium armor weakens attackers.
- Netherite armor grants protection against fire damage and resists knockback. Additionally, items made of Netherite do not burn when thrown into fire or lava.

# Equipment

- Elytra has been removed in favour of the Paraglider. This stays true to the original intent of the Elytra, to naturally glide down, before rocket boosting was added to Minecraft. 
  - You can use campfires for a small boost upwards.
  - You can build towers to glide further by starting from higher.
- Fishing Rods have more durability and has an alternate Reinforced Fishing Rod which can be given upgrades from the Tackle Box such as lines, bobbers and hooks.
- Quivers can be crafted with leather (/scraps) and cloth, and will store up to five stacks of arrows. Tipped and variant arrows are supported.

# Repairing

Gear can be repaired in an anvil and due to the removal of XP...has no need for it! A single unit of the gear's material, such as copper for copper tools and armour, will fully repair it. No more need to spend multiple diamonds on your diamond shovel! A new material known as Stardust, which can be gained by crushing a Nether Star for seven Stardust.

If you wish to repair your Netherite tier equipment, you can use a Diamond Block, which is technically infinite from fishing. Though using Stardust is probably the easier way to keep your tools doing forever if you have the right gear to fight the Wither.
