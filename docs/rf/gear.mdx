- Golden tools have fortune / looting properties. Golden armor grants slight protection against fire damage.
- Iron tools and armor have no special properties.

- Steel tools are slow but deal knockback. Steel armor grants protection against projectile damage and resists knockback.
- Griefer armor grants high protection against explosion damage.
- Sanguine armor has lifesteal properties, healing the wearer as they deal damage.
- Diamond tools and armor have no special properties.
- Electrum tools are speedy and deal kinetic damage. Electrum armor increases movement speed.
