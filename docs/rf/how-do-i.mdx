## How do I... 

When first playing Raspberry Flavoured, you may run into moments where progression isn't obvious. The usual recommendation is to check EMI info on items, and follow the advancement progression, but it can be valuable to have another (easily searchable doc to reference, hence this guide).

## How do I farm?

### How do I find wild crops?

## How do I get stronger gear?

In Raspberry Flavoured, gear isn't a linear progression. Various armour sets have had their properties adjusted to be more useful. Check out the [gear](gear) page for more info.

### How do I progress without stone tools?

### How do I enchant my gear?

## How do I get to the Nether?


## What happened to the End?

### How do I travel if there's no Elytra?

The sky (isn't) the limit here. Paragliders allow for gliding down into caves or down from tall towers, horses are great for travelling and exploring (check it out, they swim!), and trains and minecarts allow for travelling between common locations without lifting a finger.

### How do I beat the game?

You don't!
