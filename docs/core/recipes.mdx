# Raspberry Recipe Config

This system allows you to remove or modify Minecraft recipes using a standalone JSON configuration file. It hooks directly into the `RecipeManager` reload event, applying changes after vanilla data packs are loaded.

## Configuration File

- **Location:** `config/raspberry-recipes.json`
- **Generation:** The file is automatically generated with default examples the first time a world is loaded or a server is started.

## JSON Structure

The file follows a structure containing a list of modifications. Each modification object requires an `action` and a `filter`.

```json
{
  "modifications": [
    {
      "action": "ACTION_NAME",
      "filter": {
        "FILTER_CRITERIA": "VALUE"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## 1. Filtering Recipes

The `filter` object determines which recipes are affected. A recipe must match all provided fields to be selected.

### Basic Filters

You can filter by simple strings, or use **arrays** to match multiple values (acting as an OR condition).

| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `output` | The registry name of the item produced. | `"minecraft:stone_pickaxe"` |
| `id` | The specific ID of a recipe. | `"minecraft:black_bed_from_white_bed"` |
| `mod` | The mod ID that owns the recipe. | `"farmersdelight"` or `["create", "mekanism"]` |
| `type` | The recipe type. | `"minecraft:smoking"` |
| `input` | Matches if the recipe contains this ingredient. | `"minecraft:stick"` or `"#minecraft:logs"` |

### Advanced Filters (Regex & Logic)

* **Regex:** Wrap strings in `/` to use Regular Expressions.
*Example:* `"/minecraft:.*_log/"` matches all vanilla logs.
* **Logic:** Use `not`, `or`, and `and` for complex conditions.

**Example:** Remove all recipes that output Gold items, *except* those from Minecraft.

```json
{
  "action": "remove",
  "filter": {
    "output": "/.*gold.*/",
    "not": {
        "mod": "minecraft"
    }
  }
}

```

## 2. Actions

### Action: `remove`

Completely removes the matching recipes from the game. You can use arrays to remove large batches of recipes at once.

**Example:** Remove specific recipes by ID.

```json
{
  "action": "remove",
  "filter": {
    "id": [
      "minecraft:wooden_pickaxe",
      "minecraft:wooden_hoe"
    ]
  }
}

```

### Action: `replace_input`

Scans ingredients and replaces a target with a new one.

* **`target`**: The item ID (e.g., `minecraft:stick`) or tag (e.g., `#minecraft:logs`) to find.
* **`replacement`**: The item or tag to use instead.
    * **Single Item:** `"minecraft:bamboo"`
    * **Compound (Array):** `["minecraft:bamboo", "minecraft:stick"]` (Accepts either item).


**Example:** Replace Sticks with Bamboo OR Sticks.

```json
{
  "action": "replace_input",
  "target": "minecraft:stick",
  "replacement": ["minecraft:bamboo", "minecraft:stick"],
  "filter": {
    "mod": "minecraft" 
  }
}

```

### Action: `replace_output`

Changes the result of the matching recipes.

* **`replacement`**: The new item ID for the output.

**Example:** Make the Cake recipe craft a Golden Apple instead.

```json
{
  "action": "replace_output",
  "replacement": "minecraft:golden_apple",
  "filter": {
    "id": "minecraft:cake"
  }
}

```
