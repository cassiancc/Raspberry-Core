# Raspberry Recipe Config

This system allows you to remove or modify Minecraft recipes using a standalone JSON configuration file.
It hooks directly into the `RecipeManager` reload event, applying changes after vanilla data packs are loaded.

## Configuration File

- **Location:** `config/raspberry-recipes.json`
- **Generation:** The file is automatically generated with default examples the first time a world is loaded or a server is started.

## JSON Structure

The file contains two main sections: `modifications` for recipes and `tag_modifications` for item tags.

```json
{
  "modifications": [ ... ],
  "tag_modifications": [ ... ]
}

```

## 1. Filtering Recipes

The `filter` object determines which recipes are affected.
A recipe must match all provided fields to be selected.

### Basic Filters

You can filter by simple strings, or use **arrays** to match multiple values (acting as an OR condition).

| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `output` | The registry name of the item produced. | `"minecraft:stone_pickaxe"` |
| `id` | The specific ID of a recipe. | `"minecraft:black_bed_from_white_bed"` |
| `mod` | The mod ID that owns the recipe. | `"farmersdelight"` or `["create", "mekanism"]` |
| `type` | The recipe type. | `"minecraft:smoking"` |
| `input` | Matches if the recipe contains this ingredient. | `"minecraft:stick"` or `"#minecraft:logs"` |

### Advanced Filters (Regex & Logic)

* **Regex:** Wrap strings in `/` to use Regular Expressions.
*Example:* `"/minecraft:.*_log/"` matches all vanilla logs.
* **Logic:** Use `not`, `or`, and `and` for complex conditions.

**Example:** Remove all recipes that output Gold items, *except* those from Minecraft.

```json
{
  "action": "remove",
  "filter": {
    "output": "/.*gold.*/",
    "not": {
        "mod": "minecraft"
    }
  }
}

```

## 2. Recipe Actions

### Action: `remove`

Completely removes the matching recipes from the game.
You can use arrays to remove large batches of recipes at once.

**Example:** Remove specific recipes by ID.

```json
{
  "action": "remove",
  "filter": {
    "id": [
      "minecraft:wooden_pickaxe",
      "minecraft:wooden_hoe"
    ]
  }
}

```

### Action: `replace_input`

Scans ingredients and replaces a target with a new one.

* **`target`**: The item ID (e.g., `minecraft:stick`) or tag (e.g., `#minecraft:logs`) to find.
* **`replacement`**: The item or tag to use instead.
* **Single Item:** `"minecraft:bamboo"`
* **Compound (Array):** `["minecraft:bamboo", "minecraft:stick"]` (Accepts either item).



**Example:** Replace Sticks with Bamboo OR Sticks.

```json
{
  "action": "replace_input",
  "target": "minecraft:stick",
  "replacement": ["minecraft:bamboo", "minecraft:stick"],
  "filter": {
    "mod": "minecraft" 
  }
}

```

### Action: `replace_output`

Changes the result of the matching recipes.

* **`replacement`**: The new item ID for the output.

**Example:** Make the Cake recipe craft a Golden Apple instead.

```json
{
  "action": "replace_output",
  "replacement": "minecraft:golden_apple",
  "filter": {
    "id": "minecraft:cake"
  }
}

```

## 3. Tag Modifications

The `tag_modifications` section allows you to strip tags from items. This is useful for cleaning up recipe viewers (JEI/EMI) or removing unobtainable items from tag groups.

### Action: `remove_all_tags`

Removes **all** tags from the specified items. This effectively orphans the item from tag-based recipe lookups.

* **`items`**: A single item ID string or an array of item IDs.

**Example:** Remove all tags from specific items.

```json
{
  "action": "remove_all_tags",
  "items": [
    "minecraft:stick",
    "minecraft:cake"
  ]
}

```

### Action: `remove_from_tag`

Removes items from a **specific** tag, while leaving them in other tags.

* **`tag`**: The tag ID to modify (e.g., `minecraft:planks`).
* **`items`**: The item(s) to remove from that tag.

**Example:** Remove Oak Planks from the generic planks tag.

```json
{
  "action": "remove_from_tag",
  "tag": "minecraft:planks",
  "items": "minecraft:oak_planks"
}

```

### Action: `clear_tag`

The `clear_tag` action allows you to completely empty a tag of all its associated items.
This is useful for clearing out mod-added tags that you want to disable entirely or rebuild from scratch.

* **`tags`**: A single tag ID string or an array of tag IDs to be cleared.

**Example:** Clear all items from specific modded tags.

```json
{
  "action": "clear_tag",
  "tags": [
    "createaddition:plant_foods",
    "caverns_and_chasms:experience_boost_items",
    "curios:artifact"
  ]
}

```
